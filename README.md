# Alex - A Kanban App

Welcome to **Alex**, an open-source Lightning Web Component application for managing workflows visually using a kanban board. This app provides real-time updates, a Redux-like global state management, and leverages Salesforce platform events for seamless synchronisation across users.

## Features

- **Dynamic Kanban Board**: Columns and cards are generated dynamically, adapting to your configuration in real-time.
- **Real-Time Synchronization**: Uses platform events and a subscriber LWC to enable real-time updates across all users viewing the board.
- **Global State Management**: Inspired by Redux, the state of the app is managed globally by a `store` component, dispatching actions through a `service` component to interact with backend controllers.
- **Drag-and-Drop Functionality**: Cards can be easily moved across columns using native HTML5 drag-and-drop events.
- **SLDS Styling**: Designed with Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) to seamlessly fit into Salesforce.
- **Lightning Components Integration**: Leverages standard Lightning components.
- **GraphQL Adapter**: Implements the new GraphQL wire adapter to dynamically retrieve configured fields from custom metadata for the edit modal.
- **Backend with FFLib-Inspired Layering**: A robust backend structure following the FFLib Domain Driven Design pattern

## Components Overview

### Frontend Components (LWC)

- **Board Component** (`kanbanBoard`): Handles the rendering of columns and cards. This is where all event handling occurs, including drag-and-drop interactions.
- **Subscriber Component** (`kanbanSubscriber`): Listens for platform events and updates the board in real time.
- **Store Component** (`kanbanStore`): Manages the global state, dispatching actions to keep the board updated.
- **Service Component** (`kanbanService`): Handles communication between the `kanbanStore` and backend `controller` to synchronize changes.
- **Edit Modal**: Uses a Lightning card edit modal, integrated with the new GraphQL wire adapter for dynamic field configuration based on custom metadata.

### Backend Architecture (FFLib-Inspired)

- **Selector**: Handles queries to fetch relevant kanban data.
- **Repository**: Manages all DML operations (e.g., insert, update, delete) for kanban objects.
- **Domain**: Contains the business logic, including firing platform events for real-time updates.
- **Trigger Handler**: Ensures triggers run efficiently and according to business requirements.
- **Service Layer**: Bridges the interaction between selectors and repositories, ensuring clean separation of concerns.
- **Controller**: Interfaces directly with the LWC components, providing methods to execute necessary backend logic.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Salesforce CLI**: Make sure you have the latest version of the Salesforce CLI installed. Use the `sf` commands for interacting with your Salesforce org.
- **Scratch Org**: We recommend setting up a scratch org for development purposes.
